I mainly used chatgpt to fix help me find any errors that I did not notice.

prompt: "what could be causing this error for my Makefile? "Makefile:3: *** missing separator.  Stop.""
response: "... Fix indentation manually in JupyterLab

Open the Makefile in JupyterLab.
(Double-click it in the file browser.)

Turn on the command palette:
Press Ctrl + Shift + C (or click the “command palette” icon on the left sidebar).

Search for and disable “Insert Spaces for Tabs” if it’s on.

Alternatively, look in the bottom-right corner of the editor — it might say Spaces: 4.

Click that → change it to Tab Size: 4 and disable “Spaces.”

Go through your file and replace all spaces at the start of command lines with a real tab.

The tab must appear before conda, myst, and rm.

You can press Backspace to remove spaces, then hit the Tab key once.

Save (Ctrl + S)...."

response: "... **/.ipynb_checkpoints/... "


prompt: "How can I remove the existing .ipynb_checkpoints/ from my repo that were already pushed?"
response: "... git rm -r --cached .ipynb_checkpoints... "
