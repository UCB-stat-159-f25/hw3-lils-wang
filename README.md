This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that uses data from the [<u>**LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial Notebook**</u>](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial) and other files to make this repository into a reproducible research package.

There are uses of a python package to read the LIGO data as well as to process the data. Creating a binder link for this assignment follows.

Homework 3 assignment expands on this, creating new directories for the audio files and the figures to go to as well as the data. As well as adding a separate utils python file and tests for both the readligo.py file and the utils.py. Then there is the addition of making this repository into a proper MyST as well as making a Makefile to create the proper environment and properly set up the MyST
